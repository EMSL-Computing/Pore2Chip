ModEx Loop for Pore2Chip and Chip2Flow

About Pore2Chip
---------------
**Pore2Chip** is a Python module designed to streamline the process of analyzing X-ray computed tomography (XCT) 
images of soil and creating 2D micromodel designs based on that analysis. 
It leverages the power of open-source libraries like OpenPNM, PoreSpy, and drawsvg to extract key information about the soil's 
porous structure and translate it into a blueprint for microfluidic simulations or physical "lab-on-a-chip" devices developed using additive manufacturing.
